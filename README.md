I just love programming, especially creating something that looks simple but is complex. 

I can remember connecting a database with a program for the first time, getting data from one end to another and displaying it with a clean and simple design as well as fiddling around for hours afterwards so it looks and feels perfect for the enduser.
Small successes like these for example are the reason why I love what I do!
